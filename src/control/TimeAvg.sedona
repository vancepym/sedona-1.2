** TimeAvg object averages "in" over the configured time.
** The actual time is marked in a resolution of scan period (see App.scanPeriod)
** such that number of samples averaged = time/Sys.app.scanPeriod
**
** Note that this is NOT a running or moving average - this object caches the average over
** the previous time as the out value, and updates out every "time" ms.
**
** Until a full time cycle has elapsed, the out is set to the average off all samples
** collected up until that point.
**
** The average may be reset/restarted at any time using the "reset" action.
