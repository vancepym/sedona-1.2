** Test is the base class for test classes which are

** added as a test case for the test class.  Tests themselves
** are written as a series of assert statements.

  ** Helpful for calling tests individually

  ** This is to call individual test of a given type

  ** This is the main routine for running the test suite.
  ** The compiler generates the table of test functions
